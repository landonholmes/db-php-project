You can import the database from the DATABASE_DB_PHP_backup.sql file. This should include functions and triggers.

OR

Running separately, these scripts assume you are running as root and have permission to create/drop database/tables. 
It will create the datasource DB_PHP if it does not exist.
Then it will create the tables (dropping and recreating if they already exist).

Also worth noting that the system assumes there is a user named "php" with a password "password". This is not created here so for the system to work on your database you need to create this user.
